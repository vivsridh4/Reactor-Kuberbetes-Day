# [27th Nov | Azure Kubernetes Day](https://www.meetup.com/microsoft-reactor-bengaluru/events/281500483/)

By 2022, more than 75% of global organizations will be running containerized applications in production, according to Gartner, and Kubernetes is shaping the future of app development and management - and the Reactor team wants to help you get started &amp; also upskill with it today.  

In this conference, we plan to cover the basics to advance Kubernetes so that developers/ DevOps engineers can get started &amp; as well upskill.
